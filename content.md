## hero
I'm a software developer, optimist, engineering leader, and general technologist. I believe computing and software, and society in general, is currently undergoing one of the most exciting periods ever. Machine learning, LLMs, "AI", or whatever you want to call it is transforming how we use computers.

There are incredible opportunities to take advantage of this new technology and I'm excited to explore what they are.

The story so far

## story-intro
Before I got into software, I spent a few years working in group homes supporting people with disabilities. It was quiet work that taught me patience, awareness, and how to listen before speaking. That grounding shows up in how I work with teams now, staying calm under pressure, noticing the human signals, and making sure everyone feels heard before we sprint.

## story
I gravitate toward the messy middle of product development where architecture decisions meet the real needs of the people using the thing. Leading the [Strobe](https://strobe.app) team from idea to launch in just three months taught me how to keep multiple streams of work aligned without losing sight of the important product outcomes.

Today at Shopify, I design resilient systems that scale as quickly as the businesses on top of them. I’m known for clear communication, hands-on leadership, and for keeping performance budgets in the conversation from day one.

Outside work you’ll usually find me hanging out with my five-year-old son, tinkering with whatever side project has my attention that week, or clearing dungeons in Diablo IV once the house is quiet.

What keeps me curious

## focus-intro
I've found myself focusing on a few areas recently.

## focus
### Scalable products
I like to start with something that works, then evolve it under pressure. I’m interested in the invisible glue that holds systems together, queues that keep data moving, caches that smooth over latency, and APIs that stay solid under load. The challenge is always the same: build for scale without over engineering.

Good infrastructure should fade into the background. When it does its job, the product feels fast, predictable, and quietly powerful. That’s what I aim for.

### Performance-minded Rust
Rust enforces clarity: ownership, lifetimes, and immutability are design choices, not just compiler constraints. I reach for it when performance, predictability, and correctness matter more than iteration speed.

Rayon and structured parallelism make it straightforward to scale workloads safely. Profiling, tracing, and property-based testing keep assumptions honest and feedback tight. Over time, I’ve learned that performance isn’t about clever tricks, it’s about removing uncertainty and trusting measurement.

Good Rust code should be straightforward to read and dependable in production: clear intent, stable behavior, minimal magic.

### Tools for teams
The most meaningful leverage comes from helping teams move in rhythm. I care about the boring parts that make this possible: clean CI pipelines, fast feedback, well-tuned linters, and docs that people actually read.

I’ve been exploring AI-assisted development not as replacement but as augmentation, pairing bots with humans to reduce toil and surface insight faster. When used right, these tools act like good colleagues: attentive, consistent, and unoffended by repetition.

Ultimately, tools are about communication. Good ones make intent visible, friction low, and progress obvious. They let people focus on the work that actually matters. If you’re experimenting with AI pair flows, I’d love to compare notes.

Let’s collaborate

## contact-intro
Have an idea brewing, a platform that needs to scale, or a team that could use a steady hand? I’m always happy to connect.

## contact-body
Lately I’ve been prototyping small developer tools that make everyday workflows faster, little utilities that remove friction instead of adding features.
